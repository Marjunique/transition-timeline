    <h1>Transition Timeline</h1>
    <h2>A timeline for transitioning your young child with delays or a disability from diagnosis to kindergarten and beyond</h2>
    <p>
      If you think your child has a delay or a disability, it can feel overwhelming. You may be wondering if your baby is behind in hitting their developmental milestones and you’re not sure how to figure this out. Maybe your child has a new diagnosis and you are learning about a whole new world of services and systems. Maybe your child is almost 5 and you are worried about whether they are ready for kindergarten. 
      Exceptional Lives is here to help.
      This timeline will walk you through every age and stage of early childhood so you can help your child (and your family) get the right support at the right time.</p>
    <p><strong>A note about this timeline: it was developed for families in the state of Louisiana. The language and terminology may be different if you are not in Louisiana, but the process is almost exactly the same no matter where you are.</strong>

    <p>Learning that your child has a disability is a big deal!  
    Maybe you are just starting to worry about your child’s development or learning, or maybe you have a diagnosis already. 
    Either way, and no matter how old your child is, here’s where to start.

    <h2>Age 2.2 (2 years and 2 months): Connect with the school district</h2>
    <p>
      The most important step at this age is to connect with your school district and get the process started. The school district is also called the Lead Education Agency, or LEA</p>
      
      <h3>Gather assessments and reports</h3>
      
      <p>Start collecting any documents that describe your child and their disability, and put them in one place. The school district will do their own evaluation to see if your child qualifies, but any paperwork you have will be helpful for this evaluation. This may include assessments from healthcare providers, reports from earlier developmental testing, or notes from providers who have worked with your child. 
      
      The evaluation should take place when your child is between 2.9 and 2.11. This way you can have the services in place by your child’s 3rd birthday.</p>

        <h2>Age 2.9 (2 years & 9 months): Get an evaluation and prepare for the IEP</h2>
        <p>
          At this time, your child should get an evaluation from the school system to see if they qualify for special education services, and if so, what kind. 
          
          Then you and the school team will develop your child’s IEP (Individualized Education Program).</p>
          
          <h3>Check that Child Find (or Child Search) has your file</h3>
          
          <p>Make sure that your school district’s Child Find office has your file by this time. (In some parishes, it’s called Child Search). 
            
          There’s a lot to do between now and your child’s 3rd birthday, and you want everything to be in place by then so your child can start getting services right away.</p>

        <h2>Age 3: Switch to school-based services</h2>
        <p> When your child turns 3 they can start special education services if they have qualified. The goal is to have the IEP (Individualized Education Program) ready by this time so they can start the services right away.</p>  
        <p> The school system is now in charge of your child’s services.</p>
        <p> It may seem abrupt, but on your child’s 3rd birthday they will stop getting services from EarlySteps (if they had been) and start getting services from the school system. From this point on, the school is required by law to follow the IEP. The school has to start the services soon after you sign the IEP. (What if my child doesn't have an IEP yet?)</p>

        <p> If your child has qualified for special ed services and has an IEP, the next steps are to monitor their progress and keep in touch with the IEP team.</p>
          <h3>Monitor services and progress</h3>
          <p>Now you must make sure that your child is getting the right services and is making progress toward the goals described on the IEP. Keep in close touch with the teacher and the therapists as well as your IEP point person. 
            Ask how your child is responding to the therapies and how much progress they are making. Learn more about tracking your child’s progress.</p>

        <p>If your child turns 5 by September 30, they can start kindergarten in that school year. 
          (This may be different in your state.) This will be a new experience and both you and your child may need emotional support. 
          Talk to your child about the change, help them find ways to express their excitement and hesitation, and be alert for signs of anxiety. 
          Talk to their IEP team about ways to help them prepare.</p>
          <h2>Meet with the teacher about the IEP</h2>
          <p>Your child’s new teacher should be familiar with the  IEP, but check to make sure. As soon as possible, reach out and meet with them. Tell the teacher about your child: not just about their disability and services, but about who they are as a person. Some parents make a short picture book to help the teacher and new therapists get to know their child. Ask the teacher to explain how the services will be given to your child and make sure that the plan matches with the IEP.
